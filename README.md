This is an Android application developed for the Lab assignment of SDPD course.

The application allows the user to add phone numbers with which they wish to access the device location by sending a SMS to the device.
The application then sends off a SMS to the sender containing the location coordination of the device.

The application will only respond to the SMS only while it is running :( . It does not have a background service running to listen to the
recieved SMS messages.
